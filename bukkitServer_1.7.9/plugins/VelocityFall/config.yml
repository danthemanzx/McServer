#Velocity threshold beyond which the damage takes effect:
threshold: 0.6

#Multiplication modifier for determining damage:
multiplier: 10.0

#Exponential effect to help negate air resistance:
exponent: 1.1

#So the equation to find damage at any velocity is:
#  ((velocity - threshold) * multiplier) ^exponent, where velocity > threshold

track-entities: true
#This determines whether or not the damage holds true for entities
#If this is causing lag, you can set it to false

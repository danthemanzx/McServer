#Just put - <all> to enable all worlds.
#slotlock contains the players slots you want locked (0-39).
#(0-8) are the hot-bar, (9-35) are the inventory, and (36-39) is the armor.
#item is the item locked in the slot, amount is the amount of items,
#permission is the permission node you must have for the slots to be locked, 
#name is the item name, and lore is the item lore.
#The book section is for what book name in the book file will be used.
#Command is the command that will be run, null for none.
#Backpacks make it so you only start with the quick bar and armor bar.
#Then when you craft the 3 backpack sizes, you unlock more slots.
#Backpacks unlock the slots in their slots section.

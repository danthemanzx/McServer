# RealChop Properties: 
# 
# DetectBlockBreak log | leaves | all
#   Tree will fall (after physics check), when player break this type of blocks:
#   log - only LOG blocks (tree parts)
#   leaves - LOG and LEAVES blocks
#   all - any blocks
#   default: all
# 
# BlockProcessingLimit num 
#   num (5 - 1000) - setting limit of blocks for physics calculation.
#   Setting high limit can produce heavy server load, when process massive structures, builded from LOG blocks.
#   default: 150
# 
# FallingLeaves true | false
#   Process LEAVES blocks, or just LOG blocks.
#   default: false

DetectBlockBreak: all
